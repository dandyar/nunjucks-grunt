# nunjucks-grunt
_Templating system using Nunjucks &amp; Grunt._

Working demonstrations of templating system using Nunjucks and Grunt for web development.

## Installation

I'm assuming you already have node before you start if not then you'll need to [install it](https://nodejs.org/en/) before proceeding.

* Git: `https://github.com/dandyar/nunjucks-grunt.git`

Once you have your location sorted, `cd` to the root directory of bootstrap-patterns using terminal (or cmd if using a PC), then run: `npm install` if you have admin rights, otherwise `sudo npm install`. Once NPM has finished with the installation of packages you can run the task `grunt`.

### Grunt

[Grunt docs](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

### Task

Simply run the default task `grunt`, and you'll be good to go.

## Versioning
